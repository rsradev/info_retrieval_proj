### Slide 2: **Introduction**
**What is Information Retrieval (IR)?**
- Retrieving relevant information from large datasets based on user queries.
- Essential for search engines, chatbots, and knowledge bases.

**What is RAG?**
- Combines retrieval techniques with generative AI for accurate, contextual, and synthesized responses.

**Why This Project?**
- Increasing demand for systems that integrate search and AI to deliver intelligent, real-time insights.

### Slide 3: **Project Objectives**
1. Develop a robust IR system powered by RAG.
2. Handle both structured (e.g., SQL databases) and unstructured data (e.g., documents, PDFs).
3. Ensure scalability, accuracy, and low latency.

**Target Outcome**:
- A production-ready system delivering real-time, context-aware answers.

### Slide 4: **System Architecture Overview**
**Key Components:**
1. **Data Ingestion**: Collect data from APIs, databases, and files.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean, tokenize, and embed data.
3. **Vector Database**: Store embeddings for fast similarity search.
4. **RAG Framework**:
   - **Retriever**: Fetch relevant documents using vector similarity.
   - **Generator**: Use a language model (e.g., GPT) to generate contextual answers.
5. **Search API**: Expose functionalities via REST APIs.

### Slide 5: **Data Pipeline**
**Steps in the ETL Process**:
1. **Extract**:
   - Structured data: SQL databases, CSVs.
   - Unstructured data: PDFs, JSON, text.
2. **Transform**:
   - Text normalization and metadata extraction.
   - Generate embeddings using models like BERT or SentenceTransformers.
3. **Load**:
   - Store raw and processed data in scalable storage (e.g., AWS S3).
   - Index embeddings into a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS).

**Tools Used**: Apache Airflow, Kafka, Docker.

---

### Slide 6: **RAG Workflow**
1. **User Query**: User submits a query to the system.
2. **Retrieval**: Retrieve top-k relevant documents from the vector database.
3. **Generation**: Use a pre-trained language model to generate a context-aware response.
4. **Response Delivery**: Return a synthesized, actionable answer to the user.

**Example Use Case**: Customer support system fetching FAQs and generating answers.
